# Thie is my recreation of FieldVectors from processing
So i tried recreating my FieldVectors from processing using plain python code and making it independent of the processing app using a library called processing_py
but it was a failure . I was able to run the code however the animations was laggy and unresponsive.
Feel free to use the code and enhace it ! :)
